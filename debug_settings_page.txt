Warning: A call to tap() with finder "Found 1 widget with text "Sincronizar Agora": [
  Text("Sincronizar Agora", dependencies: [DefaultSelectionStyle, DefaultTextStyle, MediaQuery]),
]" derived an Offset (Offset(381.0, 936.0)) that would not hit test on the specified widget.
Maybe the widget is actually off-screen, or another widget is obscuring it, or the widget cannot receive pointer events.
Indeed, Offset(381.0, 936.0) is outside the bounds of the root of the render tree, Size(800.0, 600.0).
The finder corresponds to this RenderBox: RenderParagraph#bbf2a relayoutBoundary=up25
The hit test result at that offset is: HitTestResult(HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#73e99(_ReusableRenderView#02875), HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#0bf8a(<AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding>))

To silence this warning, pass "warnIfMissed: false" to "tap()".
To make this warning fatal, set WidgetController.hitTestWarningShouldBeFatal to true.

The following assertion was thrown during layout:
A RenderFlex overflowed by 584 pixels on the bottom.

The relevant error-causing widget was:
  Column Column:file:///C:/Users/joaom/Documents/GitHub/Music/lib/settings_page.dart:231:22

The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
like a ListView.
The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#77279 relayoutBoundary=up2 OVERFLOWING:
