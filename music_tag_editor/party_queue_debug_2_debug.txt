00:00 +0: PartyQueueView tapping end party returns to initial state

Warning: A call to tap() with finder "Found 1 widget with text "Encerrar Festa": [
  Text("Encerrar Festa", dependencies: [DefaultSelectionStyle, DefaultTextStyle, MediaQuery]),
]" derived an Offset (Offset(409.0, 604.0)) that would not hit test on the specified widget.
Maybe the widget is actually off-screen, or another widget is obscuring it, or the widget cannot receive pointer events.
Indeed, Offset(409.0, 604.0) is outside the bounds of the root of the render tree, Size(800.0, 600.0).
The finder corresponds to this RenderBox: RenderParagraph#6361a relayoutBoundary=up30
The hit test result at that offset is: HitTestResult(HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#68ff8(_ReusableRenderView#4fc9a), HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#b7b7f(<AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding>))

To make this warning fatal, set WidgetController.hitTestWarningShouldBeFatal to true.

══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY FLUTTER TEST FRAMEWORK ╞════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following TestFailure was thrown running a test:
Expected: exactly one matching candidate
  Actual: _TextWidgetFinder:<Found 0 widgets with text "Gerar QR Code da Festa": []>
   Which: means none were found but one was expected

When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:

Warning: At least one test in this suite creates an HttpClient. When running a test suite that uses
TestWidgetsFlutterBinding, all HTTP requests will return status code 400, and no network request
will actually be made. Any test expecting a real network connection and status code will fail.
To test code that needs an HttpClient, provide your own HttpClient implementation to the code under
test, so that your test can consistently provide a testable response to the code under test.
