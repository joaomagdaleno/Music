ÔòÉÔòÉÔòí EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY FLUTTER TEST FRAMEWORK Ôò×ÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉ
The following StateError was thrown running a test:
Bad state: A test tried to use `any` or `captureAny` on a parameter of type `SearchResult`, but
registerFallbackValue was not previously called to register a fallback value for `SearchResult`.

To fix, do:

```
void main() {
  setUpAll(() {
    registerFallbackValue(/* create a dummy instance of `SearchResult` */);
  });
}
```

This instance of `SearchResult` will only be passed around, but never be interacted with.
Therefore, if `SearchResult` is a function, it does not have to return a valid object and
could throw unconditionally.
If you cannot easily create an instance of `SearchResult`, consider defining a `Fake`:

```
class MyTypeFake extends Fake implements MyType {}

void main() {
  setUpAll(() {
    registerFallbackValue(MyTypeFake());
  });
}
```

Fallbacks are required because mocktail has to know of a valid `SearchResult` to prevent
TypeErrors from being thrown in Dart's sound null safe mode, while still
providing a convenient syntax.

When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:
#0      _getFallbackValue (package:mocktail/src/_register_matcher.dart:49:5)
