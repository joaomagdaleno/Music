Warning: At least one test in this suite creates an HttpClient. When running a test suite that uses
TestWidgetsFlutterBinding, all HTTP requests will return status code 400, and no network request
will actually be made. Any test expecting a real network connection and status code will fail.
To test code that needs an HttpClient, provide your own HttpClient implementation to the code under
test, so that your test can consistently provide a testable response to the code under test.
